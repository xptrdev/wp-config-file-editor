		  <p>Config File Editor Plugin created config file back from current wp-config.php file</p>
		  <p>Please copy and past the following link to safe place, use it if you having issues access Wordpress after updating Config File. The following link is only available if COnfig Editor Plugin detects Wordpress stopped and only available for one time use</p>
		  <p>The link below will immediately restore back previous wp-config.php file.</p>
		  <p class="wcfe-restore-parameters"><textarea type="text" class="wcfe-restore-link" readonly="readonly"></textarea></p>

		<p>This process will replace wp-config.php file content with content generated from the values you've entered in the form.</p>
		<p>The process is totally replace the old code with new code generated by Config File Editor Plugin and all the code you had in wp-config.php will be replaced.</p>
		<p>This is risky process and might stop Wordpress installation</p>
		<p>This process never touch your Database or any file except wp-config.php file, if Wordpress stopped you just need to revert wp-config.php file back to old values</p>
		<p>Please don't keep if you care about one of the following reasons:</p>
		<ul>
	    <li>wp-config.php contains custom code -- not originally bundled with normal Wordpress installation</li>
			<li>You're not 100% positive of the values you changed</li>
			<li>You manually added wp-config.php constants that not supported by Config File Editor plugin</li>
