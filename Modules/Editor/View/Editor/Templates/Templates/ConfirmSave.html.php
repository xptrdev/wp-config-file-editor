			  		<li>Close button won't delete emergency backup created when this window is opened, it won't not also refresh Form page, therefore it might not reflect the correct state on the server</li>

				<li>This process will replace wp-config.php file content with content generated from the values you've entered in the form.</p>
				<li>The process is totally replace the old code with new code generated by Config File Editor Plugin and all the code you had in wp-config.php will be replaced.</li>
				<li>This is risky process and might stop the site</li>
				<li>This process never touch your Database or any file except wp-config.php file, in case the site is stopped you just need to revert wp-config.php file back to old values</li>

					Please don't keep if you care about one of the following:
					<ul>
				    <li>wp-config.php contains custom code -- not originally bundled with normal Wordpress installation</li>
						<li>You're not 100% positive of the values you changed</li>
						<li>You manually added wp-config.php constants that not supported by Config File Editor plugin</li>
