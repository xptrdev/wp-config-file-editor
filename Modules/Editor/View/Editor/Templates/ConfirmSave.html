		<p>This process will replace wp-config.php file content with content generated from the values you've entered in the form.</p>
		<p>The process is totally replace the old code with new code generated by Config File Editor Plugin and all the code you had in wp-config.php will be replaced.</p>
		<p>This is risky process and might stop Wordpress installation</p>
		<p>This process never touch your Database or any file except wp-config.php file, if Wordpress stopped you just need to revert wp-config.php file back to old values</p>

		<ul>
	    <li>wp-config.php contains custom code -- not originally bundled with normal Wordpress installation</li>
			<li>You're not 100% positive of the values you changed</li>
			<li>You manually added wp-config.php constants that not supported by Config File Editor plugin</li>
